}{
\prohib{100}{Do not wear gloves}{Especially strong leather ones. They get caught easily and then `help' ripping body parts off.}
\action{52}{Eye protection recommended}{Swarf will fly. Cutters can come loose. Broken cutters can fly very far and are razor sharp.}
\action{58}{Wear protective clothing}{Wear tight fitting clothing, keep long hair tied up, no jewellery or anything else that can be caught by the machine.}
\warn{125}{Crushing}{Risk of crushing -- the machine does not have any sensors that detect obstacles.

Note that it can also run very slow; barely noticeable.}
\warn{117}{Slippery surface}{Floor will get very slippery; especially when using coolant.}
\warn{128}{Sharp rotating elements}{This machine is essentially a cutter without any guard whatsoever.}
}{
Only switch XYZ feeds when the machine is not running. Use the hand-wheel to get the gear fully locked in prior to starting the feed. Be sure to tighten all 4 nuts post rotating the head or all 4 nuts when moving the head laterally.

Try to avoid getting coolant or similar on the slide-ways -- especially the Y slipway between machine and table. Use a shield or adjust the flow. Machine needs to be cleaned post use.  When using coolant -- also empty the recess on the left of the table and clean out the t-Slots until dry.
